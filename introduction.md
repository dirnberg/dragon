# Introduction

In an era where digitalization and technological innovations are fundamentally transforming industrial production and critical infrastructures, this book provides a comprehensive and well-founded guide to implementing and optimizing Enterprise IoT solutions. It combines interdisciplinary approaches and best practices to guide readers through the complex landscape of modern industrial technologies.

This book begins with an in-depth exploration of digital transformation in production, explaining the significance and development of digitalization, clearly defining key terms and current trends. From efficiency enhancement and automation to future perspectives of digital production, this section offers valuable insights and practical case studies.

The next section delves into IT reference architectures, a fundamental aspect for understanding and implementing modern IT systems. Topics such as enterprise architecture management, business process management, and socio-technical information systems are detailed. Other key areas include data centers, multi-tier computing (multi-layer computer architectures), distributed systems, and service-oriented architectures (SOA), including the integration of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) as a platform. The chapters conclude with practical examples and best practices illustrated through case studies and applications.

The section on enterprise information systems examines managed information systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP), manufacturing execution systems (MES), product lifecycle management (PLM), as well as computer-aided technologies (CAx) and offline programming. Case studies and applications are also presented to ground the theoretical concepts in real-world examples.

A particular focus is placed on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and automation technology, covering the evolution from mechanization to the industrial internet of things and the integration of cyber-physical systems. Applications of automation technology, the fundamentals of automation, the convergence of operational and information technology (OT and IT), as well as edge, fog, and cloud computing technologies are thoroughly described. Practical insights into implementing and optimizing IoT systems are provided through practical projects and case studies.

The chapter on generative artificial intelligence (AI) covers machine learning and AI, the analysis of large datasets, and the optimization of production processes. Generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), along with their applications in image and speech recognition and text generation, are discussed. A special emphasis is placed on the applications of generative AI in industry, including predictive maintenance, with practical case studies presented as well.

The final section addresses operational resilience and industrial cybersecurity. The importance of cybersecurity in industry, security concepts and architectures such as defense in depth, secure by design, and zero trust, along with best practices, are comprehensively described. Other topics include information security management systems (ISMS), business impact analysis, risk management, the implementation and operation of security measures, business continuity management, incident response, and security audits and penetration tests. Case studies and specific projects provide practical insights and proven procedures.

By integrating interdisciplinary approaches, current research findings, and practice-oriented learning methods, this book provides a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for professionals, students, and anyone interested in modern production and critical infrastructures. It ensures that readers understand and can apply the latest technological and regulatory developments, offering valuable insights into the practical implementation of these concepts.
